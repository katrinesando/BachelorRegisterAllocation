# Readme 
Included are all the necessary files for the 3 different implementations of the Micro-C compiler.
1. The updated 64-bit compiler (/MicroC_64_Compiler)
2. The naive compiler (/NaiveImplementaion)
3. The graph colouring compiler (/GraphColouring)

See the individual folders for for the individual ReadMe. These are important as they show how to run the different implementations of the compiler.

It is important to note that it is requirement to either have WSL or run the programs on Linux, as this is the only supported platforms for linking.

## /mcexamples
Contains test cases for the compilers. Note that not all are able to run for the updated 64-bit Micro-C compiler.

## /nasm
Contains simple test programs to test that nasm and linking works as intended.

## /LexAndParse
Contains the files for parsing and lexing the Clex.fsl and CPar.fsy in the implementation folders.
